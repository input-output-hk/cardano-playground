## Advanced Configuration: Sanchonet Testnet

There is currently no pre-release version available for the sanchonet environment.

NOTE: When respun on 2024-10-21 the chain will be restored from slot 33782400.
Any Sanchonet chain participants, stakepools, integrators, etc, will need to
clear their chain state to re-sync from that point forward.

#### Configuration files

Compatible with cardano-node release [10.1.4](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/10.1.4)

```
NOTE:
The non-block-producer node config has `PeerSharing` enabled by
default, so should not be used with block-producers.

Additionally, avoid connecting a block-producer not using p2p to a p2p
PeerSharing enabled relay as the block-producer's IP will be leaked.
