## Environment: Preview Testnet

Usage: Testing release candidates and mainnet releases. Leads mainnet hard forks by at least 4 weeks.

Ideally stays long running. Only if an issue is found after it forks that's breaking should it be respun.

Epoch length of 1 day. Development flags allowed in configuration files.

Upgrade Strategy:

- Release Candidates - 1/3 of nodes
- Official Releases - 2/3 of nodes
- Hard forks - all nodes
- Community requested to only deploy release candidates and official releases

#### Configuration files

Compatible with cardano-node release [10.2.1](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/10.2.1)

```
NOTE:
The non-block-producer node config has `PeerSharing` enabled by
default, so should not be used with block-producers.

Additionally, avoid connecting a block-producer not using p2p to a p2p
PeerSharing enabled relay as the block-producer's IP will be leaked.
```
