## Environment: Pre-Production Testnet

Usage: Testing release candidates and mainnet releases. Forks at approximately same time as mainnet (within an epoch of each other).

Long running. Since this parallels mainnet, if a bug occurs here, it needs fixed properly and can not be respun.

Upgrade Strategy:

- Release Candidates - 1/3 of nodes
- Official Releases - 2/3 of nodes
- Hard forks - all nodes
- Community requested to only deploy release candidates and official releases

Changes Requested by: Release Squad Lead

Approvals Required: SRE Tribe Lead, Cardano Head of Engineering, Cardano Head of Architecture, CF Representative

Responsible: IOG SRE

Accountable: Head of SRE/Release Squad Lead

Consulted: SPOs, IOG Tribes

Informed: Cardano Core Tribe, COO, Director of Engineering, VP Community

#### Configuration files

Compatible with cardano-node release [10.5.1](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/10.5.1)

```
NOTE:
The non-block-producer node config has `PeerSharing` enabled by
default, so should not be used with block-producers.

Additionally, avoid connecting a block-producer not using p2p to a p2p
PeerSharing enabled relay as the block-producer's IP will be leaked.
```

#### Ouroboros Genesis Mode

Ouroboros genesis mode is now the default consensus mode on preview and preprod
testnets starting with node `10.5.0`.  If needed, use of praos mode and the
bootstrap peers found in the above topology file can be reverted to by setting:

* Node config's `ConsensusMode` option to a value of `PraosMode`

#### UTXO-HD

Users migrating from a node version older than `10.4.1` should also read the [10.4.1 release
notes](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/10.4.1) and
the consensus [migration guide](https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/docs/for-developers/utxo-hd/migrating)
to properly configure the node and convert the database such that a replay from
genesis can be avoided.

#### Guardrails reference script UTxO

For convenience, the guardrails script has been put on a UTxO so that it can be used as reference script in
Treasury Withdrawal and Update Protocol Parameter proposals.
