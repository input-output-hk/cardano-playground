#### Configuration files

Compatible with cardano-node release [8.9.4](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/8.9.4)

```
NOTE:
The non-block-producer node config has `PeerSharing` enabled by
default, so should not be used with block-producers.

Additionally, avoid connecting a block-producer not using p2p to a p2p
PeerSharing enabled relay as the block-producer's IP will be leaked.
