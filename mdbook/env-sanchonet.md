## Environment: Sanchonet Testnet

Usage: Testing Conway era functionality.

The Sanchonet chain will be rolled back with each new node release for testing
new features and fixes. When respun on 2024-10-21 the chain will be restored
from slot 33782400.  Any Sanchonet chain participants, stakepools, integrators,
etc, will need to clear their chain state to re-sync from that point forward.

Epoch length of 1 day. Development flags allowed in configuration files.

Upgrade Strategy: Deploy all nodes with every upgrade request

Responsible: IOG SRE

Accountable: SRE Director

Consulted: Core Tech Head of Product

Informed: Cardano Core Tribe

#### Configuration files

Compatible with cardano-node release [10.1.4](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/releases/tag/10.1.4)

```
NOTE:
The non-block-producer node config has `PeerSharing` enabled by
default, so should not be used with block-producers.

Additionally, avoid connecting a block-producer not using p2p to a p2p
PeerSharing enabled relay as the block-producer's IP will be leaked.
